The question asks us to find two intengers numbers in a list whose sum results in the given target value, and return the index of each.

1. Thus, we start the function by establishing one variable that should be a map, which will serve to store the relationship between the value and the index of the list element.

2. we'll create a 'for' loop with a counter i whoose condition is to be less than the length of the list; this counter will serve as the index of the list at each interation.
    2.1. The looping starts by creating a variable that stores the difference between the element at current index and the target value, this constant will be called complement.
    2.2. Next, a conditional should be made to check if the value of complement has already been stored in the map; if has, an array will be returned containing the current index and the index of the value found in the map with the complement.
    2.3  If the conditional is not satisfied, the elementâ€™s value and the current index will be stored in the map.

3. If the algorithm exits the loop without a return, it means there are no two values in the list whose sum results in the target value. In this case, we should throw an error to communicate this fact.
